## User Stories

A Real-time chat interface where multiple users can interact with each other by sending messages.
To enter the chat and interact with people, the user must log in using their Google account.
Once logged in, the user can read the previous messages (we limit it to 100 messages) from the chat and start chatting by sending messages.
